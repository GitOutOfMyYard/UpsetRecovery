# Upset Recovery 


## Upset Recovery is an app  to register and analise pilot roll and pitch handling inputs during upsset recovery 

### App is divided in 2 logicall blocks:
1. upset recovery - main block designed to render virtual artificial horizon and register user inputs
2. data loader - block intended for analysing data and breed a whole lotta tables and plots

App is in a pretty raw state for now, but I hope you can make it much better! Have Fun!
